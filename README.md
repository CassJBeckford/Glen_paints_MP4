# Glen paints (name TBD)
# - a full stack e-commerce web application

------
## About and purpose 

This e-commerce website was built for professional artist and photographer, Glen Beckford, as my final Milestone Project for the Code Institute Web development diploma.
My father, Glen, produces original artwork, so for this project I am building him an e-commerce platform for his shop so he can sell his artwork online.
Through this site he can share his passion for creating and designing, demonstrating his talents as a painter and photographer, and so the website has future scope to help streamline any of his freelance services .
